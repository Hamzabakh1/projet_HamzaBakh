## 🔍 Issues by Severity

### Critical (24,804 issues)
These break financial logic and must be fixed:
- **invoices.arithmetic_error** (24,694)  
  - Invoice totals don't match: `sales_amount - fees - credits_due - abs(from_balance)`
  - **Impact:** Invoicing system is unreliable
  
- **sellers.credit_limit_exceeded** (110)  
  - Sellers have issued credits beyond their limit
  - **Impact:** Risk exposure exceeded contractual terms

### Warning (10,267 issues)
These skew reporting but system continues:
- **leads.lead_before_signup** (9,030)  
  - Leads created before seller signup_date
  - **Root cause:** Data entry/timing issues
  
- **credits.status_mismatch** (655)  
  - Actual status ≠ expected based on invoices
  - **Impact:** Reporting inaccuracies
  
- **credits.credit_before_signup** (376)  
  - Credits issued before seller signup
  - **Root cause:** Business process violation
  
- **wallet.wallet_invoice_mismatch** (206)  
  - Wallet transactions don't reconcile with invoices
  - **Tolerance:** 0.01 absolute + 0.5% relative (pro-rata check)

### Info (16 issues)
Statistical anomalies worth monitoring:
- Credit amount outliers (1st-99th percentile flagging)
- Extreme conversion rates (<10% or >90% for cohorts)
- Unusual invoice fee ratios

## 🎯 Quality Improvements Applied

### 1. Robust File I/O
**Changed:** String concatenation → Direct pandas I/O
```python
# Before:
(out_dir / "data_quality_report.csv").write_text(df_issues.to_csv(index=False), ...)

# After:
df_issues.to_csv(out_dir / "data_quality_report.csv", index=False, ...)
```
✅ Handles encoding/newline normalization automatically

### 2. Smart Wallet Tolerance
**Added:** Relative tolerance alongside absolute
```python
WALLET_INV_TOLERANCE = 0.01      # $0.01 absolute
WALLET_INV_REL_TOL = 0.005       # 0.5% relative

# Both must fail to flag as issue
abs_fail = np.abs(diff) > WALLET_INV_TOLERANCE
rel_fail = (np.abs(diff) / invoices_sum) > WALLET_INV_REL_TOL
issues = abs_fail & rel_fail
```
✅ Prevents false positives on $100k sellers while catching $1 errors

### 3. Audit Trail (UTC Timestamps)
**Added:** ISO format timestamps to reports
```markdown
_Run at: 2025-10-23T16:38:12.614Z_
```
✅ Compliance-ready for financial audits

### 4. Severity Filtering (New CLI Option)
**Added:** `--min-severity` parameter
```bash
# Show all issues (default)
python part2_data_quality.py --data-dir ... --out-dir . --min-severity Info

# Show only Critical and Warning
python part2_data_quality.py --data-dir ... --out-dir . --min-severity Warning

# Show only Critical (executive summary)
python part2_data_quality.py --data-dir ... --out-dir . --min-severity Critical
```
✅ Stakeholder-specific reporting

### 5. Scorecard Independence
**Design:** Scorecard always reflects *all* issues, not filtered
```python
# Scorecard uses unfiltered `issues` list
df_score = build_scorecard(data, issues)  # Full picture
# Report uses filtered `df_issues_filtered`
generate_findings_report(df_issues_filtered, ...)  # What's reported
```
✅ No data loss; clear separation of discovery vs. reporting

## 🔬 Detailed Issue Analysis

### Top 3 Critical Issues

**1. Invoice Arithmetic Errors (24,694 issues)**
```
entity: invoices
id: [various invoice_id]
desc: "expected 12345.67, got 12340.00"
```
**Cause:** Calculation formula components are missing or incorrect  
**Action:** Audit invoice data schema and calculation logic

**2. Credit Limit Exceeded (110 issues)**
```
entity: sellers
id: [seller_id]
desc: "950000.0 > 900000.0"
```
**Cause:** Sellers issued credits beyond their authorized limit  
**Action:** Review approvals; prevent future overages at issuance

**3. Status Mismatch (655 issues)**
```
entity: credits
id: [credit_id]
desc: "actual=cancelled, expected=approved, inv_sum=523.09, issued=583.37"
```
**Cause:** Credit status not updated to reflect invoice activity  
**Action:** Implement automatic status reconciliation
